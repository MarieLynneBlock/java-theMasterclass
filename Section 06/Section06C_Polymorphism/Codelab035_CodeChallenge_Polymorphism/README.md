### Polymorphism Challenge - Car

Create a base class Car
It should have at least a few fields that would be appropriate for a generic car class
    - constructor should initialize cylinders, name, set of wheels (4), engine (true)
    - cylinders and name should be parameters

create getters
create methods (for example: startEngine, accelerate, brake, etc.)

show a message for each in the base class
create 2 sub classes
override the appropriate methods to demonstrate polymorphism in use

put all classes in one Java file ----> gonna ignore this one. //Niels says no.
