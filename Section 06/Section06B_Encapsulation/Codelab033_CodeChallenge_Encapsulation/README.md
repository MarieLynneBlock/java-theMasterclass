### Printer Challenge

Create a class and demonstrate proper encapsulation techniques

- simulate a real Computer Printer
- It should have fields for the toner level, number of pages printed and
also whether it's a duplex printer.
- methods to fill up the toner (up to a max of 100% of course),
simulate printing pages (should increase the number of pages printed).

- Decide on the scope, whether to use constructors, and anything else you think is needed.
